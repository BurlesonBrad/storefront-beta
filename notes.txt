according to this:
https://github.com/afragen/github-updater#themes
it says that a theme needs to have the "Github Theme URI" declaration in the style.css file.
Well, this kinda sucks (I think) 
Since the Storefront master repo doesn't actually have a style.css file, how the heck would it be added?
If it was added, I think it would look like this:

/*!
Theme Name:   	Storefront
Theme URI:    	http://www.woothemes.com/storefront
Author:       	WooThemes
Author URI:		http://www.woothemes.com

So, will @afragen's github updater still work if the two lines are added to the styles.scss?
As I understand that scss will generate the css needed for the theme,
what I'm wondering is if the updater php file that I'm (slowly) building upon is still going to work right :)
